Hi! I'm an undergrad at Duke University studying Computer Science and Statistics with a minor in computational biology. I'm interested in systems -- biological systems, energy systems, political systems, cognitive systems...

Previously, I've interned in data science roles at Lineage Logistics, taught computer science as an undergraduate TA, and researched the dynamics of antibiotic resistance spread.
